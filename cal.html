     <h3>Yosemite National Park, California</h3>
	<p class="p">Stretching across nearly 1,200 square miles of nature, Yosemite National Park is every outdoor enthusiast's paradise. Travelers to this national park will encounter towering waterfalls, millennia-old Sequoia trees, striking cliff faces and some of the most interesting rock formations in the United States. Hiking is the best way to enjoy a trip to Yosemite, but visitors can also go swimming in some of the park's rivers, bike the various trails and enjoy photography walks or nature programs</p>
