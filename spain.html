        <p class="p">Impressive architecture and a decadent food scene are just two reasons why travelers should check out this Spanish city. Barcelona is famous for the uniquely designed La Sagrada Familia, Park Güell and Casa Batlló, all by renowned architect Antoni Gaudí, and Las Ramblas, the wide thoroughfare populated with buskers, bars and restaurants. Speaking of restaurants, you'll want to get your fill of tasty tapas and seafood in Barcelona. Other popular things to do here include hanging on the beach and cheering on the FC Barcelona fútbol team at Camp Nou Stadium</p>
